These regular expressions are used to identify the etcd paths that need
to be signed. A value in etcd will be signed if and only if its path matches
one of the following regexp.
If the path matches etcd_controller_path_pattern, it has to be signed by a
controller (i.e. mech_vpp). In this case, the common name of the signer
certificate has to match to the regexp  given in the configuration parameter
jwt_controller_name_pattern.
If the path matches etcd_computeNode_path_pattern, it has to be signed by a
computeNode (i.e. agent/server ). In this case, the common name of the signer
certificate has to be equal to the computeNode hostname as found in the path
via the regexp.
