        Election Algorithm:-
        1) Each worker thread is assigned a unique thread_id at launch time.
        2) All threads start the election process by running this method.
        3) An etcd master key, whose value equals its thread_id, with a TTL
           equal to the recovery_time, controls the master election process.
        3) The thread that first succeeds in atomically writing its ID
           to the etcd master key, becomes the master. The
           remaining threads and go to sleep after a master has been elected.
        4) The master thread then breaks out of the election loop and
           starts doing work. It periodically refreshes the TTL value
           of its key in etcd to let other threads know that it is alive.
           It is rather important that it's work takes less than the
           heartbeat time *if* there must be only one thread running.
           It is not so much of a concern if there can be multiple threads
           running and this is just to keep the active thread count down.
        5) The sleeping threads periodically wake up every recovery_time
           to check if the master is alive. If the master key is absent,
           in etcd, they trigger a re-election and elect a new master,
           which begins doing the work.

        name - A common thread name for the group of threads
               that need to elect a master. For e.g.: forward_worker
        thread_id - A unique thread id assigned to each thread in the group
        recovery_time - Controls the master-key TTL and how often the
                        health of master is checked by the worker threads
