# From 0.20.0 above eventlet has removed the select.poll method, but pyinotify
# has a dependency on it. We don't actually use the poll object anyway (we can't:
# since eventlet doesn't monkey patch it, it doesn't work, which is why 0.20+
# deletes it), so we can fix it specifically to make the initialiser here happy.
# So we set select.poll to a dummy poll object to let the init method of
# pyinotify.Notifier complete.
