# Convert a YAML config to a VPP one.  Combines multiple files.
# Some VPP outputs don't have set values (for which the YAML will contain a
# nil value).
# Does not fix quoting.  Probably should.
# This is intended to be paired, one day, with a config file reader, to
# make config file modification possible.
